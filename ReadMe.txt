This repository contains the scripts and data necessary to generate most of the Figures used in the Paper: "Complementary strategies for directing transcription factor binding in-vivo through DNA-binding domains and intrinsically disordered regions" by Kumar et al. 2023.
Scripts and data for Figure 1,2 and 4AandE can be found in the respective folders (matFiles for data). For Figure 3 and the rest of Figure 4 the scripts can be found in the two .m files and the data is combined in redData.mat.xx, which need to be combined to generate redData.mat.
The mat files contain the variables processed sequencing data as well as additional annotation of the yeast genome.
In Detail:
1)redData.mat:
   - sTable:  meta data for each analysed strain column names should be self explanatory
   - sumProm: promoter binding data for all strains ordered according to sTable
2) your files
